Example 3: Pathogen Removal in Bank Filtration Systems.

This example shows how to calculate pathogen removal efficiency in groundwater
treatment systems using log-removal analysis. Understanding pathogen removal is
crucial for safe drinking water production from riverbank filtration.

What you'll learn:
üî¨ How pathogens are removed as water flows through aquifer sediments
üíß Why residence time (how long water stays underground) matters
üìä How to calculate removal efficiency for different system designs
‚öñÔ∏è Why averaging parallel systems requires special care

Real-world context:
Bank filtration is widely used in Europe for drinking water treatment. River water
infiltrates through riverbank sediments, where pathogens are naturally filtered out
through physical straining and biological decay. The longer water stays underground,
the more pathogens are removed.

# Section 1: Understanding Basic Log-Removal
# ==========================================
#
# The "log-removal" concept:
# - Measures pathogen removal on a logarithmic scale
# - 1 log10 = 90% removal (1 in 10 pathogens remain)
# - 2 log10 = 99% removal (1 in 100 pathogens remain)
# - 3 log10 = 99.9% removal (1 in 1000 pathogens remain)
#
# The key relationship: Log-removal = k * log10(residence_time)
# Where k is the removal rate constant (depends on pathogen type and aquifer)

flow_rate = 50.0  # m¬≥/day (water extraction rate)
log_removal_rate = 3.5  # log10 removal per log10(day) (typical for bacteria)

# Step 1: Convert aquifer properties to mathematical distribution
# (The gamma distribution describes the variability in flow paths)

# Section 2: Why Parallel Systems Need Special Treatment
# =====================================================
#
# Imagine three wells extracting from the same aquifer, each with different
# flow paths and residence times. How do we calculate the overall removal?
#
# KEY INSIGHT: You CANNOT simply average log-removal values!
# Log-removal represents exponential processes, so averaging must account for
# the fact that shorter residence times dominate the overall performance.

# WRONG method: Simple arithmetic average (commonly done incorrectly!)
