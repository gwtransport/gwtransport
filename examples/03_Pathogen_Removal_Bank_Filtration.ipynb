   "source": "## Overview\n\nThis notebook demonstrates how to calculate pathogen removal efficiency in groundwater treatment systems using log-removal analysis. Understanding pathogen removal is crucial for safe drinking water production from riverbank filtration and managed aquifer recharge systems.\n\n### Real-World Context\nBank filtration is widely used in Europe for drinking water treatment. River water infiltrates through riverbank sediments, where pathogens are naturally filtered out through physical straining and biological decay. The longer water stays underground, the more pathogens are removed.\n\n### Applications\n- Drinking water treatment design\n- Bank filtration system optimization\n- Risk assessment for water supplies\n- Treatment performance evaluation\n- Treatment performance monitoring\n\n### Key Concepts\n- **Log-removal**: Logarithmic scale for pathogen reduction\n- **Residence time dependency**: Longer contact time = better removal\n- **Heterogeneous systems**: Multiple flow paths with different performance\n- **Treatment efficiency**: Quantifying pathogen removal performance"
