"""
Functions for calculating log removal efficiency in water treatment systems.

This module provides utilities to calculate log removal values for different
configurations of water treatment systems, including both basic log removal
calculations and parallel flow arrangements where multiple treatment processes
operate simultaneously on different fractions of the total flow.

Log removal is a standard measure in water treatment that represents the
reduction of pathogen concentration on a logarithmic scale. For example,
a log removal of 3 represents a 99.9% reduction in pathogen concentration.

Functions
---------
residence_time_to_log_removal : Calculate log removal from residence times and removal rate
parallel_mean : Calculate weighted average log removal for parallel flow systems
gamma_pdf : Compute PDF of log removal given gamma-distributed residence time
gamma_cdf : Compute CDF of log removal given gamma-distributed residence time
gamma_mean : Compute mean log removal for gamma-distributed residence time
gamma_find_flow_for_target_mean : Find flow rate for target mean log removal

Notes
-----
For systems in series, log removals are typically summed directly, while for
parallel systems, a weighted average based on flow distribution is required.
The parallel_mean function supports multi-dimensional arrays via the axis parameter
and performs minimal validation for improved performance.

def residence_time_to_log_removal(residence_times, log_removal_rate):
    """
    Compute log removal given residence times and a log removal rate.

    This function calculates the log removal efficiency based on the
    residence times of water in a treatment system and the log removal
    rate coefficient.

    The calculation uses the formula:
    Log Removal = log_removal_rate * log10(residence_time)

    Parameters
    ----------
    residence_times : array_like
        Array of residence times (in consistent units, e.g., hours, days).
        Must be positive values.
    log_removal_rate : float
        Log removal rate coefficient that relates residence time to
        log removal efficiency. Units should be consistent with
        residence_times.

    Returns
    -------
    log_removals : ndarray
        Array of log removal values corresponding to the input residence times.
        Same shape as input residence_times.

    Notes
    -----
    Log removal is a logarithmic measure of pathogen reduction:
    - Log 1 = 90% reduction
    - Log 2 = 99% reduction
    - Log 3 = 99.9% reduction

    The log removal rate coefficient determines how effectively the
    treatment system removes pathogens per unit log time.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> residence_times = np.array([1.0, 10.0, 100.0])
    >>> log_removal_rate = 2.0
    >>> residence_time_to_log_removal(residence_times, log_removal_rate)
    array([0.   , 2.   , 4.   ])

    >>> # Single residence time
    >>> residence_time_to_log_removal(5.0, 1.5)
    1.0484550065040283

    >>> # 2D array of residence times
    >>> residence_times_2d = np.array([[1.0, 10.0], [100.0, 1000.0]])

           [2., 3.]])

    return log_removal_rate * np.log10(residence_times)


def parallel_mean(log_removals, flow_fractions=None, axis=None):
    """
    Calculate the weighted average log removal for a system with parallel flows.

    This function computes the overall log removal efficiency of a parallel
    filtration system. If flow_fractions is not provided, it assumes equal
    distribution of flow across all paths.

    The calculation uses the formula:

    Total Log Removal = -log10(sum(F_i * 10^(-LR_i)))

    Where:
    - F_i = fraction of flow through system i (decimal, sum to 1.0)
    - LR_i = log removal of system i

    Parameters
    ----------
    log_removals : array_like
        Array of log removal values for each parallel flow.
        Each value represents the log10 reduction of pathogens.
        For multi-dimensional arrays, the parallel mean is computed along
        the specified axis.

    flow_fractions : array_like, optional
        Array of flow fractions for each parallel flow.
        Must sum to 1.0 along the specified axis and have compatible shape
        with log_removals. If None, equal flow distribution is assumed
        (default is None).

    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which to compute the parallel mean for multi-dimensional
        arrays. If None, the array is treated as 1-dimensional
        (default is None).

    Returns
    -------
    float or array_like
        The combined log removal value for the parallel system.
        If log_removals is multi-dimensional and axis is specified,
        returns an array with the specified axis removed.

    Notes
    -----
    This function performs minimal input validation to reduce complexity.
    NumPy will handle most error cases naturally through broadcasting
    and array operations.

    Notes
    -----
    Log removal is a logarithmic measure of pathogen reduction:
    - Log 1 = 90% reduction
    - Log 2 = 99% reduction
    - Log 3 = 99.9% reduction

    For parallel flows, the combined removal is typically less effective
    than the best individual removal but better than the worst.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> # Three parallel streams with equal flow and log removals of 3, 4, and 5
    >>> log_removals = np.array([3, 4, 5])
    >>> parallel_mean(log_removals)
    3.431798275933005

    >>> # Two parallel streams with weighted flow
    >>> log_removals = np.array([3, 5])
    >>> flow_fractions = np.array([0.7, 0.3])
    >>> parallel_mean(log_removals, flow_fractions)
    3.153044674980176

    >>> # Multi-dimensional array: parallel mean along axis 1
    >>> log_removals_2d = np.array([[3, 4, 5], [2, 3, 4]])
    >>> parallel_mean(log_removals_2d, axis=1)
